Hey!

I'm Pete. I'm a software developer based in Birmingham, learning the trade one line of code at a time. 

I specialise in Full Stack languages, including JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React and MySQL. While programming isnt my first love, and I havn't had my skin in the game for as long as some others, I truly have fallen in love with programming.

You can reach me at any of the following, I look forward to it.
